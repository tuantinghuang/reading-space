          Sadie walked under the gates, one by one by one. At first, she felt
          nothing, but as she kept moving ahead, she began to feel an opening
          and a new spaciousness in her chest. She realized what a gate was: it
          was an indication that you had left one space and were entering
          another.

          A doorway, she thought. A portal. The possibility of a different
          world. The possibility that you might walk through the door and
          reinvent yourself as something better than you had been before.
        </p>
        <p>She walked through another gate.</p>
